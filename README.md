# Minecrawler Janitor

Ludum dare 48 compo game.

Everything made in 48 hours from scratch, including graphics, game logic, sound.

Code is pure gamejam magic :D

That means, you can probably tell at which point the hurry started (and the motivation loss) xD

Uses the very handy Typescript + Phaser + Rollup Template by Aivan Monceller

## Instructions

Use the arrow keys to move and jump.

Use spacebar to shoot.

Hold down X to do work:

- Use computer to process rock (this is your score)
- Go near walls that were broken by enemies to fix them

The rock critters get pretty angry at the minute mark.
